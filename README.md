# Python_Application

app1 : Generates a natural number and a list of natural numbers and outputs a number of their properties.  
  
app2 : Generating fractions from a random pairs of numbers and performing different operations on the numbers.  
  
app3 : Uses Global Temperature Time Series, avalaible at http://data.okfn.org/data/core/global-temp, stored in the file monthly_csv.csv, assumed to be stored in the working directory. Prompts the user for the source, a year or a range of years, and a month. The source is either GCAG or GISTEMP. The range of years is of the form xxxx -- xxxx (with any number of spaces,  possibly none, around --) and both years can be the same, or the first year can be anterior to the second year,  or the first year can be posterior to the first year. Output is to generate - The average of the values for that source, for this month, for those years AND The list of years (in increasing order) for which the value is larger than that average.
  
app4 : Randomly fills an array of size 10x10 with True and False, and outputs the number of blocks  in the largest block construction, determined by rows of True's that can be stacked on top of each other.   
  
app5 : Prompts the user for a nonnegative integer that codes a set S as follows: 
Bit 0 codes : 0
Bit 1 codes : -1
Bit 2 codes : 1
Bit 3 codes : -2
Bit 4 codes : 2
Bit 5 codes : -3
Bit 6 codes : 3
... Computes a derived nonnegative number that codes the set of running sums of the members of S when those are listed in increasing order. Computes the ordered list of members of a coded set.  
  
app6 : Randomly fills an array of size 10x10 with True and False, displayed as 1 and 0, and outputs the number chess knights needed to jump from 1s to 1s and visit all 1s (they can jump back to locations previously visited).
